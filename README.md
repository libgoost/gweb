# Goost Web Service

Performance first Go standard-library-like collections.

The named of goost is made from "go + boost = goost" as we want performance with our Go code since the core team don't want to maintain assembly code for some standard libraries.

> We could write the whole standard library in assembler, and have a faster result, but we choose not to because it's harder to maintain.
